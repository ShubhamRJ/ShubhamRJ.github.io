So the motivation of this idea comes from thousands and thousands of CVE (vulnerability report) emails flooding my work mail inbox almost everyday just because the ACLs (access control lists) were not configured correctly. So most of them were pretty much not relevant to me and being a frontend engineer I wasn't even responsible for managing the security issues of the deployment clusters.

Number of emails per day per person on average ~ 126 ([**Refer**](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/how-many-emails-does-the-average-person-receive-per-day/))  
1 mail size ~ 75 KB ([**Refer**](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-average-size-of-an-email-message-1171208))  
Memory required for new emails per day per person = 9.2 MB  
Number of email users out there ~ 3.9 billion ([**Refer**](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-average-size-of-an-email-message-1171208))

Total size of new emails generated per day ~ 36 PB

(Note: We are not considering email attachments, images etc. in an email still )

So, the world generates 36 Petabytes of email content daily. How much of this is actually USEFUL I ask?

Would be useful for those non-imp subs or automated cve mails. <br>Interesting read: <a href="https://t.co/TOUvHwjU8o">https://t.co/TOUvHwjU8o</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/carbon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#carbon</a></p>&mdash; Shubham (@ShubhamRJ28) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShubhamRJ28/status/1473645741251829761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
