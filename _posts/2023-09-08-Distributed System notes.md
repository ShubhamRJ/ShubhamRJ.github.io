I am taking up Distributed Systems this semester as a part of my ongoing MS in CS. The course is basically structured around a lot of research papers that needs reading and understanding. I love to make notes or just basic summaries of important points from the papers I read for a quick future reference. At the same time, I am playing around with Notion currently and I thought why not make a public page for my notes. So here it is. I will keep updating this page as I read more papers.
