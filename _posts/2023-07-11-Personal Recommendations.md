My list of personal favourties of anything and everything at one place. These are highly curated channels and blogs which I have been following regularly for more than half a year. And also so that I can remove my infinite bookmarks ðŸ˜›

Got a recommendation? Let me know in the comments below!

## <b><i>Youtube Channels</i></b>
### Tech

1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Honeypotio" target="_blank">Honeypot.io</a> - I recently saw their videos and the documentaries around the tech's biggest projects are a very very interesting watch.

### Science
1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarkRober" target="_blank">Mark Rober</a> - One of my favourite science creators. He's videos are on next level!
2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Vsauce" target="_blank">VSauce</a> - A creator I wish would be as active as before. He has answered one of the weirdest science questions. Watch his Mindfield series if you are interested in Philosophy and Psychology. 
3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt" target="_blank">Kurzgesagt â€“ In a Nutshell</a> - Very cool illustrations about interesting questions in science.
4. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium" target="_blank">Veritasium</a> - Needs no introduction.

### Other

1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RealLifeLore" target="_blank">RealLifeLore</a> - One of the best channels to just grow your geo-political and geo-economics knowledge. Highly recommended!
2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ImprovementPill" target="_blank">Improvement Pill</a> - One of the well-subscribed channel for ideas in building your own personality.

## <b><i>Creators</i></b>
1. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/addyosmani/" target="_blank">Addy Osmani</a> One of the creators whose LinkedIn content never never disappoints.
2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CleoAbram/" target="_blank">Cleo Abram</a> Her content on optimistic tech stories is a fresh change from the pessimistic news articles.

## <b><i>Blogs</i></b>

### Tech Blogs
While the major top tech engineering blogs are always a great read like <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/?gi=96c0220700d2" target="_blank">Netflix </a>, <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/" target="_blank">Uber </a>, <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/" target="_blank">Google Research</a> - these are the lesser known blogs that I love following:

1. <a href="https://blog.reachsumit.com/" target="_blank">Sumit's Diary </a> I liked Sumit's research summaries and other content on Recommendation systems using LLMs.
2. <a href="https://aman.ai/recsys/papers/" target="_blank">Aman AI </a> Aman's blog is a great resource for research papers in Recommendation systems and NLP.
3. <a href="https://web.dev/" target="_blank">web.dev</a> My personal favourite frontend engineering resource for learning and reading usecases.

### Non-tech Blogs

1. <a href="https://thedankoe.com/blog/" target="_blank">Dan Koe</a> One of my recent follows. He has some unique ideas about human potential, lifestyle design, & one-person businesses. (and he's very active of Threads :P)
