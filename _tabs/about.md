Hey there! üëãüèª I am <strong>Shubham</strong>, a 25 y'old software engineer in New York (originally from India).

> <strong>Currently</strong>: Graduate CS student at Stony Brook University, NY looking out for software engineering opportunities.   
{: .prompt-tip }

I like to consider myself a polymath when it comes to software engineering. I have an in-depth knowledge of frontend engineering (primarily React), NLP, Docker. etc. and I also have a working knowledge of backend engineering, infrastructure engineering as well. I worked on some pretty cool stuff in my previous opportunity - check out my work and recommendations <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhamjawandhiya/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Apart from the formal introduction above, I am a very curious individual. I love to read and talk about anything and everything ranging from engineering, science, philosophy, psychology, history, politics, economics, culture, food, travel, etc. 

I continuously look forward to try out new things, experience new adventures and meet new people.   
Coming to New York was one of those attempt to a new adventure and I am loving it so far! This blog is another such attempt at working on my writing skills. Let me know if you got any tips!

What else? Next in my todo list:
- Explore NYC as a local
- Improve on my guitar skills. <i>(I am so bad at this atm XD)</i>
- Work on - an open source contribution, my writing skills
- And just have fun! üëª

Look forward to hearing my experiences and ideas over here!
